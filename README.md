This Model is based on the three Mechanisms :

1. Fusion of the molecules from source compartment to the target compartment.

2. Inhibition of the molecules present at vesicle (edge) via a arbitarry boolean function.

3. Inhibition of molecules present at the target compartment by a arbitary boolean function.


** Steady state condition.
